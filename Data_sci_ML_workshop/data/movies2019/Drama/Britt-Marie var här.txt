Britt-Marie, 63 years old, has just left a 40 year old marriage and her long life as a house wife. Being told she is a nagging passive aggressive aunt, the new, only job, in small town Borg, will be quite challenging. Small town of Borg has no pride left except the young soccer team and Britt-Marie's new job is to coach them. This is the start of a journey filled with not only struggles and challenges, but also warmth and love.
